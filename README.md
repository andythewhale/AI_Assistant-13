# AI_Assistant-13
Basic assistant to be used with chat services like Discord & Slack.

I want the assistant to implement some form of AI and machine learning capabality to become a significantly good assistant that can be generalized for multiple channel purposes.

I want the assistant to have some external connections as well that would make it useful as a vitual assistant outside of a chat app. Like on a website or something.
